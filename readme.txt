main.py performs 3 functions: morphs my face into George Clooney's,
finds the mean Dane face using the dataset in "imm_face_db", uses the mean face to create a caricature of my face, and
warps my face into the average face of an indian man.

The corresponding booleans are morph, meanFace, caricature, and changeToMale. Setting any of them to True will perform that operation. All outputs previously generated are in {appropriate folder} + "output"
